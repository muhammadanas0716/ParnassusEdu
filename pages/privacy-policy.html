    <p>We will share your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy
      statement. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties.</p>
    <p>We may provide your Personal Information to companies that provide services to help us with our business
      activities such as payment processing via Easypaisa and JazzCash. These companies are authorized to use your
      Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
    <p>We may also disclose your Personal Information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar
      legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your
      safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
    <p>If AstranAI is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified
      via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal
      Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.</p>
    <p>To protect against fraud and misuse of our Website and Services, we actively analyze purchases, attempted
      purchases, and use of the Website and Services to help us identify and block individuals suspected of misuse
      and/or fraudulent activity. We may use that information, in conjunction with our security partners and/or law
      enforcement, to protect AstranAI's business and systems, your Personal Information, and assist those we reasonably
      believe may have been victimized by such fraudulent use of the Website and Services. We may share data (including,
      but not limited to, suspect payment information, email addresses, IP addresses, etc.) with our payment processors
      and law enforcement, in an effort to reduce fraud. You consent to the provision of this information (including
      keyword search data) for such investigative purposes.</p>

    <p>Our payment processing is handled via Easypaisa and JazzCash. These companies collect your billing information
      for the purpose of processing your order and subscriptions. We do not store billing information such as Easypaisa
      or JazzCash account numbers on our servers or systems.</p>

    <h2 class="privacy-subtitle">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>

    <p>When we collect Personal Information directly from you, we follow generally accepted industry standards to
      protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of
      transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot
      guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at <a
